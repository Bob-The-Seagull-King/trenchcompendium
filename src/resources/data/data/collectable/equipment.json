They can either be placed anywhere within your own deployment zone after all other models are deployed. Alternatively, a sapper may carry one on their back, and then deploy it with a +2 DICE RISKY ACTION during their Activation as long as the Sapper is not in Melee combat. In this case, it must be placed within 1\" of the Sapper. In either case, they count as both Cover and a Defended Obstacle once deployed.",

A Sapper can carry one on their back to battle, and with a single press of a button the guard unfolds by spreading its metalling wings and revealing a face of beautiful yet frightening countenance."

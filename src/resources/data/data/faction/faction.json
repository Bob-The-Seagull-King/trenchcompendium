But the Creator of the Universe came to the aid of the Faithful, and as had been written, the great Iron Wall of Dhu al-Qarnayn manifested itself in the lands ruled by the Sultan of Rûm. A call was sent to those who believe righteously and, over the coming decades, the migration of the Faithful took place across Europa, Asia and Africa. Millions perished on the road and at sea, for the Heretics and their Shaytan lords swarmed them as locusts swarm fields of ripe sesame, devouring them and building vile monuments from their limbs and heads, so they could not be buried as is decreed in the Holy texts. But once all those who survived the journey had come, the mighty Gates of al-Qarnayn were closed and the Great Sultanate of the Invincible Iron Wall of the Two Horns That Pierce the Sky was formed."

During a more serious incursion a full muster of Azebs is called, the House of Wisdom unleashes its terrifying takwin creations upon the foe, and if the need is desperate, the Sultan himself comes forth and his Janissaries march with him to do battle, carrying their green flag before them."

Though an understanding between the Church and the Sultanate on being co-belligerents against Jahannam exists, the commanders of these expeditions will tolerate no interference and do not hesitate to crush those who would hinder their mission. Resentment against the infidels who unleashed Gog and Magog runs deep in the Sultanate, and matters of honour are swiftly resolved with duels to the death. Woe to those who dare to hinder the mission of Those Who Believe."

These warbands are simply given commission by the Duke, and have to raise their own coin and muster their own forces. However, holy relics, great wealth and fame across all the Christendom ensures that there is a steady supply of ambitious leaders who are willing to risk all in the crucible of war.

There sits seven of the greatest, most wicked and cunning of Arch-Devils, each representing one of the Seven Mortal Sins made manifest. They are the rulers of the Court of the Seven-Headed Serpent which oversees Hell’s war against Creation on Earth. Each is known as one of the Heads of the Serpent, and ultimately it is their commands that dictate all the military forces of the Great War in the service of the infernal hierarchy."

Towering statues of the Serpent Heads representing Wrath, Envy, Pride, Gluttony, Greed, Sloth and Lust are erected in Dis by slavering work gangs of yoke fiends, only to be torn down again and crushed into rubble as new Devil Lords rise to the pinnacle of power by trampling over their rivals."

                "content": "The hierarchy of the Court is anything but stable: only Mammon is said to have held the position of the Serpent Head of Greed almost without break for the duration of the entire Great War. Other positions have seen a bewildering parade of dukes, marquises, margraves, barons and baronesses, paramounts, princes, lords, ladies, earls and myriad other high nobles that make up the infernal hierarchy. This whirlwind of political glory, followed by utter ruin, is reflected as shifts of power amongst their mortal followers on earth. The Council operates on majority vote and often with the thinnest of margins. It takes very little for an ambitious prince or princess of Hell to make so many enemies that they are deposed and their wings torn, forced them to begin their ascent from the bottom once more, with the mockery of their rivals burning them like venom."

The might of the demons also waxes and wanes based on how many mortal followers they can corrupt to their cause, and thus there is a constant change in which demon lords can don one of the seven serpent-headed crowns."

Yoke fiends muster under the banners of their praetors and sorcerers. The shattered forms of the Hell Knights are forced into their suits of armour, emerging from their fiery tombs where their bodies are kept crushed under mighty, ever-turning slabs of black basalt while they are not serving in the war effort. Desecrated Saints are brought forth to act as unholy war altars that pollute and pervert the land which they travel over. Ahead of the warbands fly Pit Locusts, the clatter of their wings heralding the coming of the Court, their poison stings leaving burns that cannot be healed. And sometimes, when the deathly omens in Hell’s burning sky and black stars are favourable, a Hunter of the Left-hand Path will join a warband as they strike out from the Mouth of Hell. As the warband marches to join the Great War, joyous and triumphant music played by unseen hands can be heard at these times, for taking part in one of these hunts is seen as a great privilege within the Sheol."

These unfortunate souls possess not a drop of demon blood. They act as disposable shock troops or are used as subjects of torture to power the Goetic magic of the sorcerers and other users of the dark arts. Captured during one of the hunts of the Court, sold to the devils in the heretic domains or having the misfortune to have foolishly pushed through in the places where the borders of the world are thin, their minds are scarred by witnessing the horror of damnation while still alive. Willing to do anything to escape their fate a million times worse than death, they grasp at the thinnest of straws. Should a wretch bring down a mighty opponent, the Law of Hell is clear: the mortal will gain its freedom, in memory and honour of the First Rebellion when there was war in Heaven and blood of the angels painted the firmament red."

They fell upon the people of the Middle East, Asia and Europa. They crushed the mortal armies sent against them like fire burning dry chaff. Only at Antioch and at the Iron Wall were they eventually checked, though at a terrible cost. Meanwhile, awed even by these least of Hell’s servants, countless men and women fell to their knees at the sight of the dark splendour of the Court and worshipped them as gods. Those with truly wicked hearts were spared and they became the first heretics. Eventually their numbers would swell into the millions who now fill the teeming cities and domains under the shadow of the Hellgate."

The Court also carefully limits the size of these warbands, so that most of the suffering and dying of the Great War is done by mortals, both to spite the God-Tyrant YHWH, but also to enhance their own power, as more humans are corrupted and die in the rebellion, the more God’s plan is disturbed and the greater the power of the devils waxes."

A mighty praetor could strike at a militarily insignificant village only to kill a new-born future saint, betray their own mortal followers by suddenly falling upon some unsuspecting heretic settlement or even clash with a warband of a rival Head of the Serpent. The wise do not question the motives of Hell’s rage and Heretics accept these occasional attacks against their forces as a fitting judgement for their lack of success in the war against the Faithful."

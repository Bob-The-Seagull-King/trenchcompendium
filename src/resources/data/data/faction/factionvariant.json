In deepest secrecy Rashid al-Din Sinan, the undisputed ruler of Alamut dispatches his hand-picked disciples on Missions of his own, communicating their orders with no spoken words, signs nor written messages, but talking directly to them in their dreams. What the purpose of such operations is no-one knows, and not even the most sadistic Heretic torturer-priest has been able to make them divulge the secrets of Alamut from captured Assassins. These warbands are known as Fida’i (which means ‘Sacrifice’), dedicated to completing their mission and returning to Alamut to receive rewards said to be able to match those of Paradise itself. They are led by a Master Assassin: one of the deadly Hands of Alamut, with two fully-trained members of the Order. A number of trainee acolytes will serve them during the mission, eager to prove their mettle and be initiated into the Order of Assassins."

Its libraries, workshops, forges, gardens of exotic and wondrous plants, hospitals and observatories are unmatched. Within its halls are mechanical marvels and weapons from far-off lands, as well as trophies captured by the Sultan’s forces and brought to be examined by the learned scholars of the House of Wisdom. Philosophers and theologists debate in its chambers; ghanzal and qasīda poets compose verses describing the beauty and pain of life. Thus it is no wonder that the House attracts the greatest minds of the age to study in its hallowed halls, from within the Sultanate and far beyond the Iron Wall."

The House of Wisdom also maintains the Sultanate fleet of airships, which both guard the realms of Those Who Believe against enemy air forces and maintain vigil over lands under darkness. They make regular excursions deep into enemy territory to witness whether the Great Sandstorm still covers the Two Holy Places, reporting any news back to the Sultan."

Sometimes they are journeys to capture an especially ferocious beast of the enemy. At other times they seek to capture or kill Heretic Alchemists which they see as both an offence to their craft and a threat to the entire world."

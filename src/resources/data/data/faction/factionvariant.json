In deepest secrecy Rashid al-Din Sinan, the undisputed ruler of Alamut dispatches his hand-picked disciples on Missions of his own, communicating their orders with no spoken words, signs nor written messages, but talking directly to them in their dreams. What the purpose of such operations is no-one knows, and not even the most sadistic Heretic torturer-priest has been able to make them divulge the secrets of Alamut from captured Assassins. These warbands are known as Fida’i (which means ‘Sacrifice’), dedicated to completing their mission and returning to Alamut to receive rewards said to be able to match those of Paradise itself. They are led by a Master Assassin: one of the deadly Hands of Alamut, with two fully-trained members of the Order. A number of trainee acolytes will serve them during the mission, eager to prove their mettle and be initiated into the Order of Assassins."
